![revamping the blog with Node.JS](/img/personal/posts/revamping-blog.jpg "NodeJS")

**From now on this blog will be held in english only. Despite I am not a native english speaker, I feel more easier writing in Shakespeare language. I writing this post to announce the upcoming blob revamp.**

The blog is currently running WordPress with a full LAMP stack on one my own dedicated server. That totally an overkill setup. Moreover WordPress is fatnessing day after day. I only need to run a personal blog system, not a whole CMS engine.

My choice went to a light NodeJS based blog engine, that does only why I need. It is called [**Lectroid**](https://github.com/rgrove/lectroid), it doesn’t require database, posts are stored in markdown.

I also decided to completely lighten the dev process and wanted to give PaaS a try. I played a couple of days with several ones and chose [**Pagodabox**](https://pagodabox.com/), which meets my needs. I will use [**Cloud9 IDE**](https://c9.io/) and Git for versioning and deploying to Pagodabox. I’ll keep you all updated.
