Vagrant is defacto standard when it comes to managing your developement machines. It allows you to spin a multi-VM developement environement in a second. 
For more details....[VagrantUP](http://www.vagrantup.com).

Vagrant isn't a provisioning tool, but leverage the existing one, such as [puppet](http://puppetlabs.com) and [ansible](http://www.ansible.com). Ansible is the new one in the playground. The learning curve is pretty steep, you only write your playbook in YAML, and it is devOps friendly.
Give it a try and clone my example project [vagrant lamp ansible](https://github.com/killerwolf/vagrant-lamp-ansible) and get started.
